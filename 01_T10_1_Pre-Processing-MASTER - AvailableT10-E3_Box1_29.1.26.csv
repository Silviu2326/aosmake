Contract talent bridges the gap between workforce capability and required performance. Many people choose contract employment based on lifestyle needs including career flexibility and the exposure to new environments and opportunities.
","The hiring challenge that businesses face when it comes to recruiting is the lack of time, technology, tools, or bandwidth to identify the right talent for an open position.  The risks of passing on qualified impact candidates and wasting time interviewing the wrong candidates lengthens the time to hire, costing the company significantly.

Here is what every hiring manager should know when filling a position: 


1. What is the cost of the open role to the organization?
2. How to communicate the WHY of your organization, so that top talent would consider exploring the option to work with you
3. Have an interview and hiring roadmap in place so that you present the job consistently to all candidates to keep them engaged and interested
4. Know what job flexibility is required to fill the open position and when contract or direct hire is the best solution

Consistent reinforcement of these four activities will maximize hiring so that you and your team will see measurable results.

Lloyd Staffing partners with companies to help fill critical positions so companies can get back to business!  Whether you need flexible contract/temporary talent or a direct hire – our innovation, systems and interview expertise takes the burden off of you. 

If your organization is challenged with time and bandwidth to fill pivotal roles, let’s have a conversation.  Whether or not we decide to work together, I will share hiring and interviewing insights that can have a significant impact on your business and talent outcomes.

","What We Do
At MedSource Consultants, we’ve spent the last 30 years mastering the art of healthcare recruitment. From permanent placements to locum tenens staffing, we connect hospitals, clinics, and healthcare organizations with top-tier physicians and advanced practice professionals—efficiently and effectively.

How We Do It
With three decades of experience and a talent pool of over 700,000 candidates, we combine long-standing relationships with cutting-edge AI to match clients with the right professionals—fast. Our contingency-based model means you only pay when we deliver, and our proactive recruiting strategy helps you stay ahead of staffing shortages before they happen.

Why It Works
Every unfilled role drains tens of thousands in lost revenue daily. Many staffing firms flood clients with resumes that don’t fit. We do things differently. Our hands-on, quality-first process ensures each placement is a lasting match—reducing turnover, improving operations, and ultimately, elevating patient care.

👉 Who We Help

Hospitals & Health Systems – Scalable staffing across specialties like IM, FP, Peds, GI, Neurology, Orthopedics, OBGYN, Surgery, APPs and other specialties upon request.

Clinics & Group Practices – Cost-effective, strategic recruitment support

Behavioral Health Facilities – Deep expertise in placing Psychiatrists and PMHNPs

Primary Care Networks – Focused solutions for urgent care, hospitalists, and family/internal medicine

👉 What Sets Us Apart

Stronger Candidate Matches – No more resume overload or poor fits!
Specialized Recruiters – Every Rep on our team is an Expert with many years of experience!

","When it comes to hiring, do you like being surprised?
 
Have you been thrown off by a short-notice resignation, an accelerated project timeline or an Accounting and Finance team that is overloaded and on the brink of burnout?
 
If I have your attention, then read on….
 
The recruiting business is about people. I don’t have a magic wand, promise miracles, or claim to control what anyone will do.
 
What I CAN OFFER… is my innate curiosity and honed “gut” intuition that kicks in when getting to know others. This, coupled with years of experience placing high quality candidates on an interim basis (or otherwise), has allowed me to take the sting out of negative surprises. 
 
I have done this within multiple industries over my career, but I have the strongest track record of helping clients attract and land the right Accounting and Finance talent within the Private Equity, Energy Trading and Manufacturing sectors. 
 
Talance’s client base is diverse enough that I can typically advise on trends and shifts in the candidate market before it becomes evident on a larger scale. This allows me to offer suggestions and solutions on ways to hire more strategically once immediate fires are put out.
 
I am not a “paper pusher”. If my team can’t provide what you need in a candidate for some reason, I will share the roadblocks as to why. I will not waste your time, that of our candidates’ or my team’s.
 
I understand that interviewing can be an exhausting process that takes you away from your “real job”, but my clients will tell you that I am committed to listening, sending fully vetted, high-quality candidates, and making the hiring process as efficient and painless as possible!
 
If you are just looking for a “body” or throwing out a role to multiple agencies at a time, I may not be the best choice for you. If, however, you are open to having an honest business conversation around your biggest hiring challenges, I’m worth a phone call.
