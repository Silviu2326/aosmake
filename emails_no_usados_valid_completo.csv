A Leadership Legacy Builder approach that ensures every hire contributes to your company’s long-term success.

I don’t just recruit. I architect legacies. And if we work together, it’s because your company is worth the blueprint.","Most executive recruiting is a numbers game. Mine isn’t.

I don’t pitch stacks of résumés and pray one works. I hand-deliver high-impact leaders across all disciplines—from C-suite executives and division presidents to operational experts, sales leaders, marketing visionaries, land acquisition strategists, construction pros, and beyond—who fit your culture, drive your vision, and elevate your game.

I partner exclusively with homebuilding, residential construction, and real estate development companies that understand the value of getting it right — companies who want a Leadership Legacy Builder and a High-Performance Team Builder, not just a recruiter.

For 25 years, I’ve built a network of industry game-changers who transform companies into category dominators. They don’t apply to jobs. They don’t return cold calls. But they answer when I call, because they know ""Erica Lockwood Executive Recruiter"" only brings confidential executive search opportunities worth their time.

I protect your brand. I strengthen your leadership bench. I make hires that outlast the business cycle through a Culture-First Executive Search process that’s built for results. That’s the difference between a recruiter—and me.

Great companies aren’t found—they’re built. And they’re built by leaders I place. End of story.

Contract talent bridges the gap between workforce capability and required performance. Many people choose contract employment based on lifestyle needs including career flexibility and the exposure to new environments and opportunities.
","The hiring challenge that businesses face when it comes to recruiting is the lack of time, technology, tools, or bandwidth to identify the right talent for an open position.  The risks of passing on qualified impact candidates and wasting time interviewing the wrong candidates lengthens the time to hire, costing the company significantly.

Here is what every hiring manager should know when filling a position: 


1. What is the cost of the open role to the organization?
2. How to communicate the WHY of your organization, so that top talent would consider exploring the option to work with you
3. Have an interview and hiring roadmap in place so that you present the job consistently to all candidates to keep them engaged and interested
4. Know what job flexibility is required to fill the open position and when contract or direct hire is the best solution

Consistent reinforcement of these four activities will maximize hiring so that you and your team will see measurable results.

Lloyd Staffing partners with companies to help fill critical positions so companies can get back to business!  Whether you need flexible contract/temporary talent or a direct hire – our innovation, systems and interview expertise takes the burden off of you. 

If your organization is challenged with time and bandwidth to fill pivotal roles, let’s have a conversation.  Whether or not we decide to work together, I will share hiring and interviewing insights that can have a significant impact on your business and talent outcomes.

We have been consistently recognized as the premier recruitment firm servicing a variety of industries including Private Equity, Hedge Fund, Asset Management, Investment Banking, Trading, Brokerage, Real Estate, Technology, Media, Entertainment, Insurance and more.

...and more

I lead consultant and temporary staffing services for financial and professional services clients. My focus: placing high-performing professionals in finance, accounting, trade support, operations, risk, legal, compliance, human resources and office services for firms requiring immediate capability without permanent headcount.","I place high-performing professionals in consultant, temporary, and fractional roles for financial and professional services firms. My specialty: delivering qualified talent quickly for critical finance, accounting, trade support, operations, risk, legal, compliance, human resources, and administrative/corporate services when companies need immediate capability without long-term commitment or permanent headcount.

I also support high-volume project staffing. From tax season surges and year-end close to audit readiness, and operational ramp-ups, I build and deploy teams quickly so firms can meet deadlines and manage peak workloads without disruption.

Over 20 years, I've built this expertise from the ground up. I launched Mission Staffing's Consultant & Temporary Staffing Division from inception, establishing infrastructure, compliance protocols, and recruiting workflows that enabled rapid talent delivery to hedge funds, private equity firms, banks, broker-dealers, and law firms. Before that, I spent over 13 years at International Market Recruiters, progressing from Recruiter to Senior Vice President while developing deep knowledge of financial services talent markets.

What differentiates my approach: I prepare every candidate thoroughly before interviews—not just with role background, but with insights into why the position is open, who they'll meet, and what to expect from the firm’s culture. This preparation significantly increases placement success rates and reduces client time spent on interview cycles. I've also served as a legal liaison on employment matters, partnering directly with counsel on overtime eligibility and contract negotiations, which reduces compliance risk for clients.

Currently I'm a Managing Director at Northbound Executive Search, where I focus on consultant and temporary placements across financial and professional services. I work with companies ranging from boutique hedge funds to large asset managers, placing talent across accounting, finance, trade support, operations, risk, legal and compliance, human resources, and office services.

During this time, I have had the privilege of being part of remarkable teams, guiding two separate locum tenens firms from startup to high-growth stages. All Star Healthcare Solutions has been the true highlight of my professional life. Co-founding the locums organization with two other incredible partners, and later adding key members of our now-executive team, has propelled us to industry-leading growth. With the perfect blend of culture and execution, our organization is now among the top 5-7 locum tenens firms nationwide in terms of revenue, and we're only continuing to grow.

A significant milestone in our journey was our recent transaction and partnership with Knox Lane, which has further strengthened our capabilities and growth potential.

Involved in start-ups, I have had the opportunity to touch and develop nearly every aspect of the sales and operational sides of the business. However, my greatest joy comes from seeing others grow into roles that help the organization thrive, while also fulfilling their own career paths. I believe in a leadership style best described by Lao Tzu: “A leader is best when people barely know he exists; when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.”

This industry has given so much to me, my organization, and communities across the country. As a way to give back, I served on the Board of Directors and as the President of the National Association of Locum Tenens Organizations (NALTO). Additionally, I volunteer as the Chair of the Legislative Committee and serve on the Membership and Ethics Committees. I also sit on the board of YPO Palm Beach and work with budding entrepreneurs on start-ups in multiple industries, including technology, hospitality, commercial and residential real estate, and construction.

563,T10_1,Jeannine,Bellaci,Sales Director,"Driving Innovation at the Crossroads of AI, Cybersecurity, Engineering & Human Health

I’m a seasoned executive and strategic connector with over two decades of experience in technology and innovation staffing—now stepping boldly into the future of AI, Robotics, Cybersecurity, and Advanced Engineering.
Currently deepening my expertise in artificial intelligence, I’m committed to becoming a Subject Matter Expert (SMRE) in these frontier technologies. I believe that the next wave of innovation must serve both humanity and progress—with ethical, scalable, and intelligent solutions for healthcare, construction, and engineering","Tech-forward sales leader + innovation pathfinder focused on AI, cybersecurity, robotics, and human health. With 20+ years in talent strategy, I now operate at the crossroads of emerging tech and real-world impact. I help companies grow with purpose—where code meets care. Let’s build what’s next, together.

I started in the technical staffing industry on a whim because I had finished college and was not quite sure of my next step in life. I was taken in by a great company initially,  New Boston Systems,  at the very beginning of what  would become a successful career as an IT Staffing Specialist. I have over 15  years of IT Staffing experience in the Bay Area. I started in the Dot.com Boom as a Technical Recruiter primarily focused on placing application developers with an expertise in Java Development while at New Boston Systems. I interfaced mostly with Fortune 500 clients like Wells Fargo Bank, Charles Schwab, Bank of America and Visa International. I always believed that I had the extra ability to find top IT Talent and lead and mentor teams of recruiters. When I was at TEKsystems, I advanced my career by stepping up to train and mentor junior IT Recruiters. I was still a top producer and a President's Club winner but wanted to help my team mates and teach them how to better advance their careers. I joined Mainz Brady Group in the summer of 2006 where I was fortunate enough to become a Senior Staffing Manager with a very elite group of other Senior Recruiters and Account Managers. I spent the first year as a Senior Recruiter and then  then wanted to help Eric Brady and Richard Mainz grow their organization so I jumped into a Senior Account Manager Role and basically pounded the pavement to bring in new business on a daily basis. I worked very hard at building a network of candidates and clients that I continue to do business with today. I am a 10 time President's Club winner and the Top Producer in the Bay Area region. I eventually evolved into a role of a Selling Branch Manager where I led a team of recruiters and sales folks as well as had to produce and maintain my own book of business simultaneously. I love leading and selling and I work daily to strive for a great balance of servicing my clients and training my team members.","Alameda, California, United States",5 years 3 months in role,5 years 3 months in company,2025-11-11T15:06:25.137Z,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAAXMogBA7ScBIJalrhKAeErVBnfuWWZn5A/,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAAAAXMogBA7ScBIJalrhKAeErVBnfuWWZn5A,NAME_SEARCH,M4IJ",jbellaci@bstonetalent.com,valid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE

Redefine traditional staffing models through long-term strategy, innovative and localized operations, and values-driven leadership.

Key responsibilities:
-Set vision and strategy, rooted in partner trust and clinician advocacy
-Guide scalable staffing models tailored to community needs
-Align business growth with mission-driven impact
-Reduce partner reliance on short-term, transactional staffing
-Integrate tech to streamline operations—without losing the human touch

Olaro is a company of unified brands privately funded by Proeza, a portfolio management company composed of purpose-driven businesses committed to a more prosperous and harmonious tomorrow.","I didn’t set out to become a CEO — I stepped up because the healthcare staffing industry needs to change. Too many hospitals are struggling with traditional models that don’t serve them or their patients. That, combined with an increasing scarcity of clinicians, leads to decision-making that places profit over people. As a result, clinicians are made to feel like they are commodities. That’s not healthcare. And that’s not sustainable.

At PHHI, we’re building something different: a people-first, tech-enabled, and partnership-driven model that helps hospitals and clinicians thrive together. I lead with a core belief: healthcare is personal — so workforce strategy should be too.

 We don't fill shifts. We build relationships. We are stewards of those we serve.  We support clinicians beyond placement. We help healthcare systems create sustainable staffing models, especially in overlooked communities where workforce instability threatens care quality. And we do it transparently — because trust is the foundation of everything we build.

As we reimagine healthcare staffing, I’m focused on:

• Driving long-term viability over short-term fixes
• Helping hospitals reduce reliance on transactional staffing
• Creating clinician-first models grounded in respect and readiness
• Using tech to enhance, not replace, the human connection
• Building scalable and culturally aligned workforce solutions

The future of healthcare staffing will belong to those bold enough to reject outdated norms, put people at the center, and lead with trust.

Our team has the experience to truly listen to and understand your needs then deliver the results you’re looking for. Give us a call today and let us help you succeed.

To really make a difference in this profession we must provide better service and insight with a stronger set of core values that drive how we do our jobs. That’s why we focus on building long-term relationships based on trust and superior client service. Every day, we strive to deliver the highest level of satisfaction to the candidates we place in permanent and temporary positions.

I am a leader of Truity Partners and our Executive Search practice. While I love working with our Executive Search clients, candidates and team, I also have the opportunity to help support the growth of our business in the Madison and Appleton markets and I'm passionate about hiring great people to join our team.","I’ve been building trust in the recruitment business for over 25 years by making and keeping one promise at a time. Trust is built by doing what you say you’re going to do and by doing the right thing for your clients and candidates every time – even when no one is watching. 

I knew right away that this career was a perfect fit and I’ve never looked back. I love it here. I love learning about companies and their needs, getting to know candidates and their stories, and then matching the two of them up so that both parties have what they want. I feel fortunate that I work in a career that I love and that I'm part of a collaborative, supportive and fun team of passionate professionals. This is my career. I’m not in it for one transaction or a quick placement. Everything I do today is with the intention of building lasting relationships and trust down the road.

I’ve learned a lot during the years I’ve spent in this profession. Here’s what I believe:

• Long-term relationships are essential.

• Do the right thing every day and it’ll pay off in the long run.

• Always take the high road. Period.

• Confidentiality is critical. Our business hinges on the fact that our clients and candidates are willing to talk to us. If they tell us something confidential, we treat it that way.

Prior to merging with Conexus, Colleen was co-founder and partner at Citadel.  With over 20 years of business knowledge, her deep understanding of organizational dynamics and process in small to large company environments provides strategic direction and long-term success to the businesses we serve.

She began her career as Controller of a consumer products company, overseeing Accounting, Technology and Human Resources functions that successfully navigated the business through rapid growth for many years.

She then took on a leadership role with an international, publicly held, multi-billion-dollar firm specializing in accounting and finance consulting, guiding them in the opening of new offices and divisions, always working side by side with the clients in the region as well as turnaround specialists for struggling business units.

She served as Orange County Director of Client Services for Tatum LLC, which was a national firm focused on services around the office of the CFO and CIO.

After Tatum was sold to a strategic buyer, Colleen jumped into a startup and was one of the founders of Beacon Resources, which specialized in accounting and finance consulting and placement.  Beacon quickly grew to be one of the fastest growing management companies in Orange County, according to the Orange County Business Journal for four years running and was later successfully sold to Gryphon Investors/DLC.

Prior to co-founding Citadel CFO in 2020 and merging with Conexus Recruiting within the first year of the firms establishment , Colleen was a partner and founder of Tactical Cloud, which was a consultancy focused on cloud ERP and reporting tools such as NetSuite and Adaptive.  Tactical Cloud was successfully sold to a strategic buyer, Eide Bailly, after only three and a half years of rapid growth.","Laguna Niguel, California, United States",5 years 9 months in role,5 years 9 months in company,2025-11-12T08:07:43.699Z,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAJFZFYBxB0kpnmfF9fiWebn-vbA9wdc904/,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAAAJFZFYBxB0kpnmfF9fiWebn-vbA9wdc904,OUT_OF_NETWORK,x09j",colleen.f@conexusrecruiting.com,valid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE

Bridging the gap between a company’s purpose and a leader’s passions and strengths has proven to be a more accurate predictor of success than the skills, qualifications, and background that form the basis of traditional search efforts. The Y Scouts process has proven effective in delivering purpose-aligned and performance-proven leaders to our clients.","Sara Pizarro serves as the Vice President of Operations for Y Scouts. 

In her role, Sara leads the recruiting and research teams and supports the firm's overall operations. With a decade of experience in the recruiting arena, Sara was drawn to Y Scouts core values and reputation for delivering purpose-aligned and performance-proven leaders.

Ultimately, Sara would create a talent bench of growth-orientated CEOs and Presidents who Tide Rock could partner with to identify and acquire new portfolio companies. Sara was also responsible for implementing processes and procedures around talent acquisition for the internal hiring of Tide Rock employees.

-End-to-end workforce mobility: we handle housing + transportation
-Designed to reduce turnover, increase retention, and boost operational efficiency

Whether clients are expanding, facing production spikes, or dealing with ongoing labor shortages, we provide a scalable, people-first solution that works.","Built Different: National Recruiting Meets Workforce Mobility.

988,T10_1,Nicholas,Brock,Manager,,"Passionate and tireless recruiter and leader.  I approach talent acquisition with an open mind, valuing both candidates and clients through a wide lens perspective. My commitment lies in not just filling positions but in strategically aligning business needs with individuals who seamlessly integrate into the company's culture, and constant hands-on development of my team.

On the recruiting side, I pride myself on establishing genuine connections with candidates, delving beyond resumes to understand their aspirations and motivations. This depth allows me to not only position them optimally for their next opportunity but also allows me to act as a trusted career counselor, guiding them towards long-term success whether it be through me, or another opportunity.

On the client side, I leverage my training and business instincts to uncover the root of their challenges. Instead of a quick-fix approach, I focus on addressing the true business needs before presenting suitable candidates. It's a strategic mindset that goes beyond merely ""chucking candidates"" and ensures a thoughtful and effective solution to their staffing needs.

On a more personal business note, my work ethic is the cornerstone of my identity.  This is something that was instilled in me from a young age.  A decorated all-state athlete in high school, I overcame a severe shoulder injury to walk on to the University at Buffalo Division 1 FBS Football Team.  I quickly worked my way into a starting spot at Fullback, and earned a full athletic scholarship.  I went on to become a 3-year starter and scholar athlete academically.  I now carry that same approach into my professional life.  This lunch pail, hard hat mentality of consistently doing the right things every day has shaped the man I have become.

In my personal life, I am an avid weightlifter and a well-accomplished powerlifter.  I set national records in the 275-pound weight class.  My best lifts include a roughly 600 lb bench press, 800 lb deadlift, and 800+ lb squat, all without any wraps or equipment. I also run and play in a men's league ice hockey team, the ""Lindy Buffs,"" paying homage to Sabres Coach Lindy Ruff.  Off the ice, I am a sauna enthusiast.  I've built my own and love talking about anything and everything sauna/cold tub treatment, investments of all kinds and of course UB FOOTBALL!  Lover of XL dogs, including my Cane Corso, Roman.  For those who wonder about the nickname, ""Boomer,"" it's been with me since birth, a testament to my size and presence.

Truex Métier is the reincarnation of Truex Associates, one of the most successful and well known staffing companies in the Bay Area during the 80s and 90s. Founded in 1983 by Mary Ann Truex and John Cullens, Truex Associates grew to 500 contract and permanent employees throughout California. Truex Associates along with its sister company, Truex Temps, were sold to a publically traded staffing company in 1998. 

After the sale, John and Mary Ann became involved in various venture capital and nonprofit endeavors including 6 years of research into Positive Psychology and its effect on corporate productivity. This was the most exciting of all of their ventures. Can positivity actually have an impact on the productivity and profitability of an organization? 

There are several successful companies that are helping their clients improve positivity in their existing employees, but why not recruit and hire positive employees instead of “fixing” them later? Few companies have the recruiting experience and the expertise in Positive Psychology required to source and evaluate positive candidates. And we all know that positive, highly productive candidates don’t fall into our laps or spend their lives searching job postings; they must be sought after. 

Truex Métier is the integration of two decades of staffing experience and the power of Positive Psychology working together to assist our clients in the science of hiring positive, productive employees. As important, is our ability to test and teach existing employees the power of positivity in their work and personal lives. That is our true métier.

It determines whether we survive infancy, which diseases we get, how we age, and how long we’ll live. Within it lie the secrets of who will respond, and how, to potential threats to our health. Understanding it is the key to fighting disease and improving health for all. Yet its complexity has limited our ability to tap into its potential—until now.

Recent advances in AI provide the tools to rapidly process the trillions of datapoints required to model the immune system, understand how it varies across individuals, and develop targeted approaches to elongating healthspans and combatting disease.

The Human Immunome Project (HIP) was designed to meet this moment—to combine systems biology with the power of artificial intelligence, to decode and model the immune system to improve health for all.

Vision: We envision a future that harnesses the power of the immune system to improve health for all.

School by day and adult workforce training by night, we are positioned to leverage change in the local community in El Salvador providing a needed framework of remote work.  

Our flagship project is in Chalatenango, a rural department in El Salvador with over 300,000 inhabitants.  Its economy has been centered historically in agriculture and additionally was hit hard during the nation’s civil war from 1980 until 1992.  Economic forces made agriculture no longer a sustainable economy which has led to forced migration to the USA with families looking for economic opportunity.  The economy is now highly dependent on remittances from Salvadoran immigrants. There have been other impacts of emigration like separated families, mental health, a further fractured education system, and loss of most talented young people for long term economic development.

The goals of the Adult Education Center will be to train cohorts of adults in short intervals for entry level tech jobs like data entry, data labeling, talent sourcing, Google Suite, and Spanish customer service reps.  The program will promote basic English fluency and specific technical skills to complete important tasks for international companies.  Upon completing certificates, our organization will help place adult residents into entry level placements to work remotely from El Salvador, helping to create a new industry in the area.  Graduates will pay back a portion of their salary to cover current students in the program to create a self-sustaining model after initial startup.

We are launching our school in January serving Kindergarten and 1st grade partnering with the Catholic Bishop in the area.  We will be adding a middle school and high school in subsequent years to fill out a full K-12 school in 5 years.

HRMC.com has been working to give you back the freedom to 1) Add or change what Assessment Test or Assessment Vendor is connected to each job, 2) Ask important questions to your applicants up front, 3) Give every applicant an Automated 1st Interview without needing a resume.  

People are complex. Few are reducible to a resume or a set of responses to standard interview questions.  ATS systems are only as good as the (less than 100% reliable) data candidates enter.

Over 40 million candidates have been engaged by Acclaim -- where no two engagements are exactly alike!

Born and raised on Long Island, NY, I grew up idolizing the Islanders, Jets, and Mets—teams that may not always win, but are definitely loveable! While I wasn’t athletically gifted like my sports heroes, I found my talent in connecting with people and making them laugh.

I didn’t know recruitment was an industry until a recruiter recruited me into it—and it turned out to be a seamless transition. That recruiter clearly had a good eye for talent!

My passions lie both with business and making this world a better place. I thrive on starting and building businesses or improving existing companies that need help.

For example, when the European Sales Director at Visual Numerics left suddenly, I was asked to go over there, ""hold down the fort"" and hire a replacement - a three month project. I ended up staying on board for 5 years! It was a tough time during the first year - the company was well established, but not doing great. At my strong urging, we completed a challenging restructuring of my division (that became part of an overall company overhaul) and the next year my division returned to profitability. My team members became more enthusiastic, motivated, and successful at their respective jobs, and they're still in contact with me to this day.

I thrive on creating, developing and deepening relationships - with clients, partners, vendors, anyone and everyone to help us all succeed in business. That leads to ever-growing revenue for my company, satisfied clients, happy and successful staff, and a rewarding career path for me.

Over the last 20 years, the Internet has changed the way we live, from booking travel to watching movies, and from paying taxes to banking. Online transactions are faster, cheaper to execute, more convenient, and generally more secure. Residential real estate, by contrast, remains stuck in a high-cost business model that pre-dates the Internet and remains stubbornly resistant to change. Harnessed properly, technology can help a lot – already, nearly 90% of consumers looking for a home go to sites like Zillow or Google to find and eventually select the properties that best suit their needs.

We created REX in 2015 to bring residential real estate into line with today’s expectations by using AI and big data to push past the outmoded practices of traditional real estate brokers to provide a superior outcome for both buyers and sellers at one-third the cost. So how does REX do it? We use data modeling and machine learning to match sellers and buyers of homes as accurately and speedily as possible on Zillow, Google, Facebook, and more. And by doing that, we can reduce costs for all involved - REX covers both sides of the transaction instead of the 5-6% charged by traditional brokers.

Unlike traditional brokers, REX licensed agents are salaried and incentivized to satisfy customers rather than to just close transactions in pursuit of a fast commission. Our team partners with sellers and buyers from listing to close, and shares with them the information they need via an easy-to-use web dashboard. REX is uniquely designed to simplify all of the moving parts, helping consumers with escrow, titling, service connections, mortgage and insurance shopping and keeps securely in the hands of the buyers and sellers all of the data related to the home and legal and financial information related to the transactions.",,Real Estate,105,"Austin, Texas, United States",http://www.rexhomes.com,,2014,,,100 MILLION,500 MILLION,0,1,12,2025-12-10T13:05:56.750Z,https://www.linkedin.com/company/rex---real-estate-exchange/,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/company/4819179,TRUE

1519,T10_1,Andree,Frost,Client Partner/Managing Director Recruiting,,"📞 From Yellow Pages to LinkedIn: 30+ Years in Recruiting

When I first started in recruiting, it was a different world. Cold calls from the Yellow Pages were the norm. Then came fax machines, email, and now, everything revolves around LinkedIn and job boards.
But while technology has changed, one thing hasn’t: businesses need the right people, and people need the right opportunities.

🔹 Adapting, Growing, and Thriving 🔹

Over the years, I’ve evolved from administrative recruiting to healthcare (orthopedics) and, for the last 18 years, I’ve specialized in accounting & finance at Staff Financial Group. I work closely with CEOs and presidents—leaders who know exactly what they need. They trust me to deliver, and I thrive on the challenge. Finding top-tier talent quickly is what I do best.

🔹 Relationships Built on Trust 🔹

Many of the professionals I’ve placed have become clients. Many clients have become friends. When they call, we talk business—but we also talk about life, especially our dogs (I have three golden retrievers 🐶). It’s these connections that make my job so fulfilling.

🔹 Why I Love What I Do 🔹

There’s nothing better than a candidate calling to say, “Thank you for helping me land my dream job.” Sometimes it’s about a higher salary, sometimes a shorter commute, and sometimes it’s just about finding the right culture fit. On the client side, I love knowing that the right hire allows them to focus on growth instead of constantly searching for talent.
They say, “Do what you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life.” After three decades, I still feel like I haven’t worked a day.

Because we consult with clients as an extension of their HR teams, our close partnerships increase search efficiency, resulting in better candidates and reducing cost per hire. We work on an hourly, adjustable basis, so clients have the flexibility to use our recruiting expertise as a supplement to their staffing departments as needs occur within their organizations.

From full-cycle recruiting to pipeline development, flexibility and service have become the hallmark of the firm, enabling JCSI to be successful for more than a dozen years through some challenging economic times. Our model continues to thrive today, and although we are constantly refining our tools, the basic tenets of customer service, value, and candidate research and engagement remain.

As we constantly improve on our process and delivery to clients, I continue to be committed to advancing cutting-edge practices and offering the best recruitment services available.

After years of opening restaurants and serving up unforgettable experiences (both on the plate and in life), I discovered my real passion wasn’t just about food, it was about people. That passion led me to finding my groove as a Recruiter with Murray Resources, one of the country’s top recruitment firms.

In my role, I get to do what I love most: build lasting relationships. Whether I’m working with early career professionals or C-suite executives, my focus is on understanding each individual’s journey and aligning them with the amazing clients we partner with. There’s nothing more satisfying than making that perfect connection and seeing both sides thrive.

🔑 What I bring to the table:
•	A knack for building genuine relationships
•	A collaborative spirit that drives success
•	Resourcefulness with a dash of “disrupt the norm” energy 
•	Full engagement in every step of the process, no shortcuts here

✨ At the core of what I do is helping people find where they want to go next in their career, and ensuring our clients gain talented professionals who share their values. It’s more than just matching resumes with job descriptions; it's about creating opportunities that make an impact.

🐾When I’m not busy matching talent with opportunity, you’ll find me outdoors with my two dogs, checking out Houston’s food scene (because some restaurant habits never fade) or cheering on my favorite sports teams!

I have owned my own businesses, then began helping others as a business coach, as well as a financial and personal coach. 

All of this has led me to the healthcare staffing agency Elite365, where I work with our nurses to help them personally and in their career. 

As the clinical nurse advocate with Elite365, it's my job to give nurses and managers a trained ear of someone who knows the job, firsthand, and who can answer questions and provide the kind of multi-sided support they won't experience anywhere else. 

In fact, we created Elite365 with one simple mission: to make nursing a brighter, better career destination by taking care of nurses in remarkable new ways. Modeling the generosity of care and love for service, practiced by healthcare professionals, we designed a remarkable new approach to nursing as well as travel nursing that nurtures and supports nurses at every stage of their journey.

All together, it means a better way to work, serve, and earn.

Our commitment is to cultivate a culture of continuous improvement, genuine collaboration, and enduring success, empowering your business to excel in today’s dynamic market

Philosophy......

Sales: Focus on the future, create urgency, qualify prospects, deliver solutions, and commit to professional excellence.

Leadership: Cultivate belief in shared vision, prioritize learning and development, master details, champion change, emphasize accountability, and maintain honesty.

Data-Driven Decisions: Use data to inform questions, rely on team insights, and harness the power of internal marketing.","I have 25 years recruitment experience across UK, Australia and US. In that time I had success moving from $1m biller to Leader to Entrepreneur. 

By 2008, I co-founded ConSol Partners, an award winning tech staffing business built on a clear philosophy:
* Control and Accountability: Success is driven by individuals, not luck or circumstance.
* Specialization: Focus on high-value, future-proof industries rather than low-value, high-volume models.
* Learning and Development: Invest heavily in training and progression for every team member.
* Innovation: Focus on what’s coming next and stay ahead of the curve.

We stayed true to these principles, growing the business to $50 million in annual sales with offices in four global locations and placements in over 60 countries. We grew the business rapidly and in 2013 I moved back to Los Angeles to establish and grow our US presence. By 2019, after 12 years of growth and hard work, we achieved a full exit by selling to a public company at 8.6x multiple. 

That’s when I embraced my next chapter.
Today, I’m based in Los Angeles, where I focus on investing in tech, private equity, and real estate.  Through MDC Ventures, I help businesses and leaders master the art of growth, innovation, and leadership with a specialism of helping UK companies establish and scale stateside. 
My approach is built on hard-earned lessons and straight-talking honesty.

Here’s what I’ve learned along the way:
* Be Yourself: People buy into people, not façades. Show your personality, admit mistakes, and let others see who you really are.
* Take Risks: You can’t achieve something extraordinary without stepping outside your comfort zone.
* Know Yourself: Your career should reflect your values, not someone else’s expectations.
* Build a Philosophy: Success comes from having a clear approach to how you work and lead.
* Focus on the Future: Always look five years ahead. Where will the opportunities be? 
* Embrace Accountability: Own your success, and take responsibility for your outcomes.

I’ve built a multi-million $ businesses, interviewed hundreds of people, and now work as an advisor and investor. But the truth is, I’m still learning every day. If you’re ready to embrace the same mindset—one of urgency, accountability and action—then I’d love to help you carve your own path to success.

• Convert relationships into board opportunities

Our Clients:

The Result:
Our clients stop hoping for board calls and start evaluating multiple opportunities.

2329,T10_1,Eric,Moravcik,Chief Operating Officer,,"How do you know if a recruiter has your best interest in mind?

Most times, you don’t. 

The #1 barrier between a manager and a recruiter is trust. It comes down to putting your trust in someone that knows what they’re doing. A recruiter that has a dialed-in, full desk process who gets IT. 

In which case it’s really up to you to choose which type of recruiter and which type of process you’re going to put your trust in. This is where IT Accel comes in. 

We TRULY get IT!!

➡️ What do we do? 

We get top IT talent working for your company while building a relationship founded on mutual trust, integrity, and the desire for success.

• Direct Hire Placement
• Contract Consulting
• Executive Search
• Retained Search
• Project Outsourcing
• Staff Augmentation

➡️ How we do IT? 

We use a combination of old-school recruiting principles with new school speed to provide you with optimal candidate results. 

• ‘Old school’ meaning full-desk — we don’t cut corners when finding you the right candidate.
• ‘New school’ meaning full utilization of tools — we find the right candidate quickly and with successful results.

For us, the recruiting and placement process is an art. We don’t pile up resumes for you simply because the keywords match. Instead, we take the time to understand the role you’re looking to fill and the culture of your company. 

We recruit by recommendations and referrals because word-of-mouth is more credible than none at all — we build relationships based on facts.

Job boards are quick, but they aren’t all-inclusive when it comes to sourcing the ideal IT candidate.

➡️ Why we do IT: 

You deserve an A1 team. 

You deserve a knowledgeable and dedicated company to connect you with the most suitable individual for your open roles. 

With IT Accel, you CAN:
• Achieve objectives for growth
• Achieve operational efficiency
• Gain competitive advantage

As the founder of Level-C Solutions, Brad designed and built the firm to help business owners of small to mid-market businesses solve their people problems, avoid some of the challenges he has faced firsthand, and find the right talent for their teams going forward.  In addition to Level-C Solutions, for over 10 years Brad has been working with Signature Back Office in a fractional new business development mode to help recruiting and staffing firm owners develop the best strategy for growing their business profitably.  

To give you a little background - during his career Brad pioneered a pro-active staffing service vs. the traditional reactive temporary help approach and took a start-up branch for one of the national companies in the industry to number one in the company in 18 months.  He was then recruited away to a competitor to manage the DFW Region and successfully led a turnaround effort and turned 10 years of losses to profitability within 2 ½ years.   

Then Brad started Staffing Services, Inc. from the kitchen table and built it to become one of the Top 25 firms in the Dallas / Ft. Worth market with 4 locations plus an expansion to Denver.  At its peak SSI had 500 people out on assignment every day until 911 changed the world causing him to shut down his operations.  That is when he started his current business model originally as Staffing Alliances and re-branded the firm in 2009 to be Level-C Solutions as it is today.  Giving us a great deal of flexibility - Level-C Solutions works with and represents multiple executive search firms, independent recruiters, staffing agencies, back-office solutions, human resource professionals, and other services providers tied into the people part of business to execute and implement the solutions designed for the end client.

With over 30 years of business ownership, staffing and recruiting, and C-Level experience - once we understand the direction you want to take your business and the challenges you face we will know if we can help you solve some of your problems. And if we don’t have the solution, we usually know who does and will happily point you in that direction.

Spent 14 years in a Senior Executive role developing and growing an Atlanta based Staffing organization's Franchise program to $200MM. 

Owned and operated a Staffing Consulting business for many years assisting with start-ups and developing franchise programs as expansion vehicles for organizations throughout the country. Consulted for companies such as SelecSource, People 2.0, Welcomemat, and Stafftime.  During this time, I began my experience with acquisitions by successfully managing an acquisition and performing diligence of a $55m specialized healthcare staffing company for a Westcoast strategic buyer.  Through another consulting assignment, I was recruited to become President of a Cincinnati based commercial staffing company where, through acquisitions and organic growth, I led the Cincinnati company to record growth before divestiture. 

I later partnered with Silver Oak Services Partners PE to acquire a $35m Cleveland Ohio based skill trades staffing company where, as CEO, we successfully completed three tuck-in acquisitions and the expansion into 9 new markets through de novo offices.  I led the organization to $100m Revenue and triple the EBITDA over a 3-year period. This ultimately led to a lucrative sale of the company.

Establishing a reputation as an aggressive growth leader and a change management specialist, I have developed relationships with numerous Private Equity firms and have been hired by some of these firms on an interim basis to lead and restructure underperforming portfolio companies.  At the beginning of 2019, I was retained for a four-month assignment to evaluate and restructure a $70m healthcare staffing organization to maximize valuation for a sale.  Most recently, I was retained by a PE firm for an ten-month interim CEO role in order to restructure and turnaround a highly underperforming $50m mechanical company with the goal to position the organization for sale to a potential strategic buyer.
 
Upon completion of this project, I joined Great Range Capital, a midwestern PE firm, as the CEO of one of their portfolio companies called Labor Source, LLC.  Labor Source, LLC operates under the names One Source Staffing and Catstaff which specialize in the restoration and emergency response staffing sector.

Additionally, I sit on the board of directors of two other staffing organizations.

As a former in-house Head of Talent & HR, I’ve seen firsthand the impact of bringing on the right (and wrong) early hires. I make sure that leaders get it right so that talent becomes a competitive differentiator for their brand, rather than a costly mistake. 

Most recently, I led Talent Acquisition & HR at Cumulus Coffee and Ergatta, reporting directly to Founder-CEOs and hiring across GTM, G&A, Ops, Product, & Tech. Today I support a portfolio of seed to series B startups as a fractional recruiter and talent consultant. 

My approach is pragmatic and stage-specific, designed to flex with the evolving needs of growing companies. If you’re looking to scale your team or have questions about how I work, reach out to me at brielle@franklintalent.co to learn more!

That’s why I started – HealthCare Talent and Workforce Solutions Group – to provide a new kind of talent acquisition and workforce strategy model to the marketplace. My passion for creating connections and opportunities in the healthcare industry is why we’re always looking for new ways to innovate, serve our clients, build talent communities, and connect great people.  

Our approach centers around solutions that are designed to align a client’s business and workforce. Maximum value is driven by providing high quality services, creative solutions and rapid execution. 

It is critical, in today’s hyper competitive employment market, that organizations develop like partnerships with companies that are 100% committed to identifying top talent exclusively for them versus attempting to cast a wide net and service everyone in a given market. 

That’s what sets us apart for our competitors, we build programs that are exclusive to our client base rather than attempting to be a me too!

Twenty-five years’ experience in management, sales, operations, and marketing – with two decades devoted to human capital consulting for Fortune 1000 companies – across a range of industries allows me to quickly identify gaps and create solutions that addresses each client’s  unique needs. 

We use a novel approach to help our healthcare clients get qualified talent in an industry struggling to find skilled workers. Our One Placement – One Scholarship program is a collaborative partnership with healthcare clients and local educational institutions designed to train people with necessary skills, and then get them to work where they’re most needed to fill critical vacancies.

Early exposure to those of diverse backgrounds sparked a curiosity and desire to help fulfill the career aspirations of others.  The process of identifying and aligning talent in ways that change lives drives the vision of our organization. 

Aleron is a leader in talent workforce management and outsourcing services. Our brands include Acara Solutions, Broadleaf Results, Lume Strategies, SDI and Viaduct.  Our teams and affiliates work throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and 10 other countries in Asia, EMEA and South America. 

Talent acquisition is much more comprehensive a task than the word “staffing” implies. My goal for Aleron is to serve as a thought-leader in the talent business.  Founded in 1957, we focus on the agile delivery of people, process, and project outsourcing solutions.  Our talent solutions deliver qualified talent through staff augmentation, direct placement services, and executive recruitment.  Our proactive process solutions include managed service programs, recruitment process outsourcing, vendor management systems, independent contractor compliance programs, and supply chain management. Finally, our project outsourcing services include the management and delivery of CAD services, equipment training, IT services, and HR projects.

What differentiates Aleron’s services is our emphasis on soft skills, behavioral traits, and cultural fit in all we do.  In an often commoditized industry, we remain patient and focused on delivering exceptional service to customers in need.

The talent landscape continues to evolve.  With these changes in mind, my aim is to focus our talent-delivery skills on definable goals and provide tailored solutions that are innovative and bold, mirroring the direct, fair, driven, and tenacious approach I’ve prioritized throughout my career.

2516,T10_1,Richard,Nguyen,Founder & CEO,"At NextDeavor, we set out to modernize recruiting, not by replacing people with tech, but by empowering them through it.

I led the company from bootstrapped beginnings to a tech-enabled recruiting firm that delivers AI-powered talent solutions with a human-first approach. In 2025, we were acquired by Pioneers to scale our mission even further.

Highlights:

Built and scaled a recruiting platform that combines AI automation (job matching, outreach, candidate prioritization) with personalized recruiter workflows.

Enabled 24/7 recruiting workflows that sourced, matched, and initiated outreach on jobs posted after hours, turning hours into minutes.

Helped clients optimize for IPO-readiness through workforce planning, compliance, and strategic hiring.

Delivered over $20M in placements across tech, engineering, HR, and marketing functions.

Reimagined contingent workforce models and embedded talent solutions to drive real-time scalability and hiring velocity.

Integrated product-led growth strategy by aligning tech tools with recruiting performance and measurable outcomes.

NextDeavor continues to support companies navigating the future of work, with a focus on blending empathy, speed, and insight in every hire.","I build companies by building people first.

At the core of my journey is one belief: technology should enhance human connection, not replace it. That’s why at NextDeavor (now part of Pioneers), we’ve built a recruiting engine that puts people at the center — powered by AI, but driven by empathy, strategy, and experience.

Our platform blends AI-driven job matching, intelligent outreach, and automation with real, human-led conversations, giving companies speed, precision, and personalization all at once. We've eliminated friction in hiring, scaled sourcing overnight, and freed recruiters to do what they do best: connect.

After 15+ years in the staffing and talent space, I’ve seen the industry evolve, and I’ve helped it evolve. From contingency search to full-cycle AI workflows, I’m focused on solving the most human problems in hiring with the best technology available. Whether you're scaling a team, preparing for IPO, or reimagining your workforce, I believe there’s a better way to grow.

We work alongside youth and adults, especially those impacted by trafficking, foster care, abuse, and systemic marginalization, to create pathways to resilience through trauma-informed care, crisis intervention, advocacy, education, and community collaboration.
We believe that every individual—regardless of their past—deserves the opportunity to reclaim their voice, rebuild their life, and thrive in a world that recognizes their inherent worth. Our mission is not only to intervene in crises but to transform systems and narratives that perpetuate vulnerability, offering access to empowerment where barriers once stood.
EAF is committed to restoring hope and creating pathways of healing for children and adults who have experienced severe trauma and abuse. EAF provides direct support services such as emergency housing, trauma-informed case management, vocational access, financial assistance, access to medical, dental and vision services and enrichment opportunities.
Our work centers around the belief that every individual deserves to feel seen, safe, and supported. Our services currently extend across Florida, with program expansion underway in Central Florida.
In our first year, we launched an Emergency Backpack and Dignity Bag program with law enforcement partners, built survivor-centered service pipelines to access medical, vision and dental care, and began preparing a series of fundraising and community education events to deepen our impact.

EAF envisions a world where survivors are no longer defined by their trauma but empowered by their strength; where systems serve with compassion, and where every person has equitable access to healing, justice, and opportunity. EAF seeks to be a bridge—between crisis and stability, between surviving and thriving—restoring power to those who have been silenced, overlooked, or discarded.
We envision communities that are trauma-informed, survivor-led, and rooted in equity—where lived experience is honored as expertise, and where all youth and adults have access to the tools, relationships, and support they need to flourish.

EAF seeks to partner with community-minded organizations like Universal Orlando to raise critical funds while sharing the message that children and survivors are not alone in their recovery journey.","Rocklin, California, United States",5 months in role,5 months in company,2025-11-17T15:17:52.924Z,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAADP_LgBZV7LCtm15aATCTUGTtZUKKy5tng/,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAAADP_LgBZV7LCtm15aATCTUGTtZUKKy5tng,NAME_SEARCH,R_UF",kklein@ciginsurance.com,valid,Capital Insurance Group,"Established in 1898, Capital Insurance Group® (CIG) is a leading regional property and casualty insurer in the Western U.S. Headquartered in Monterey, California, CIG offers trusted Agriculture, Commercial, and Personal coverage across Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.
